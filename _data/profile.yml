    I am Jian Lang, currently a master candidate in Software Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), 
    under the supervision of Prof <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ihj2Rw8AAAAJ" target="_blank">Fan Zhou</a>.

    My research interests focus on multimodal learning, specifically addressing learning problems under missing or incomplete data modalities. 
    I also conduct in-depth analysis in multimodal social media data. Recently, my research extends into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and open-domain question-answering.
    I have published several academic papers in top conferences (KDD,WWW,AAAI,SIGIR) in related fields.
