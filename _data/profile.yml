  <p>
    I am Jian Lang, currently a master candidate in Software Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), 
    under the supervision of Prof <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ihj2Rw8AAAAJ" target="_blank">Fan Zhou</a>. 
    Before that, I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Fuzhou University. 
  </p>
  <p>
  My research interests video content analysis (popularity prediction, malicious content detection), and robust multimodal learning (incomplete multimodal learning, domain adaption). 
  In addition, I also explores applying Multimodal Large Language Models to part of these domains to enhance their performance and interpretability.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am now looking for 26 fall PhD positions. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my research or potential collaboration opportunities.
